```js app.js focus=3
import Circle from "./circle";
const red = "hsl(0 85% 60%);

## Add something

This is how the file looks to start.

```js app.js focus=2
import Circle from "./circle";
const red = "hsl(0 85% 60%);
```

## Now we're going to add something.

```js app.js focus=3
import Circle from "./circle";
const red = "hsl(0 85% 60%);
const blue = "hsl(0 85% 60%);
```
